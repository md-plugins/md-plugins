## Plugin-Specific Questions

### How do I add custom classes to images?

You can use the `image` plugin to add custom classes to images. Here is an example configuration:

```typescript
import MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it'
import { imagePlugin } from '@md-plugins/md-plugin-image'

const md = new MarkdownIt()

md.use(imagePlugin, {
  imageClass: 'custom-image-class',
})
```

### How do I extract and process frontmatter content?

You can use the `frontmatter` plugin to extract and process frontmatter content from your Markdown files. Here is an example configuration:

```typescript
import MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it'
import { frontmatterPlugin } from '@md-plugins/md-plugin-frontmatter'

const md = new MarkdownIt()

md.use(frontmatterPlugin, {
  grayMatterOptions: {
    excerpt: true,
    excerpt_separator: '<!-- more -->',
  },
  renderExcerpt: true,
})

const env: MarkdownItEnv = {}
const html = md.render(code, env)

console.log(env.frontmatter)
```

const md = new MarkdownIt()

  defaultLang: 'javascript',
  containerComponent: 'MarkdownPrerender',
  copyButtonComponent: 'MarkdownCopyButton',
})
```
